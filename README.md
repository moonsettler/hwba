# HWBA
## Hardware Wallet Based Authentication

Describes proposed methods for using hardware wallets (secure, 'air-gapped' device) to manage critical secrets used for authentication.

## Motivation

The line of thought that led to the development of hardware wallets can be extended to all parts of ones digital life and security. Securely managing keys and passwords and other secrets is a daunting task, various password managers reveal the critical secrets in plain text at one point or an other. Same is true for some popular 2FA solutions where a shared secret is exposed as plain text upon registration.

## Concept

* Only reveal secrets in plain text on the display of the hardware wallet!
* Cryptograhically secure communication of critical secrets via unsecured device!
* Use the seed+passphrase as the root and single point of failure of secret management!
* Use the cryptographic primitives of the bitcoin protocol already present in the hardware wallets as much as possible!
* Do not complicate the recovery protocols for hardware wallets with any additional data they must store!
* Do not expose the HD seed directly to HWBA module SDS is derived with deterministic irreversible one way cryptographic function!
* Use secp256k1 ECDH Elliptic-curve Diffieâ€“Hellman for key exchange!
* Provide 2FA with RFC 4226 HMAC-based One-Time Passwords!
* Provide 2FA with RFC 6238 Time-based One-Time Passwords!
* Provide crpytographically secure non-replayable authentication via secp256k1 ECDSA!
* Provide a method to decrypt and display passwords (for legacy systems)!
* Provide deterministic secure password generator functionality (for legacy systems)!

## Requirements for the hardware wallet

* Supporting primitives for bitcoin secp256k1 ECDSA, SHA256, HMAC-SHA512
* Camera capable of reading QR codes.
* Display capable of presenting QR codes.
* Internal clock (for TOTP support)

## Limitations

No form of secure authentication can theoretically protect against a sophisticated man-in-the-middle session hijack attack on a compromised device. HWBA is most useful on a potentially compromised device where either a keylogger or other more sophisticated but unattended mass targeted spyware/malware specifically aimed at collecting secrets, keys and credentials is running. HWBA will not guarantee any protection in case of active hostile survailance and remote control. Services should nevertheless ensure repeat authentication or 2FA challenge at every action where serious harm, loss of data or loss of funds can result from executing it.

## Protocol
### ECDHA secret sharing basics
> GUID: binary form of "33771967-c51f-4e84-99e8-7541fd64e14b" \
> SDS: Seed Derived Secret HMAC-SHA512(GUID|Seed|Phrase) never leaves HW \
> Method: "HWBA/\<version\>/\<scheme\>/\<method\> \
> Account: "name@domain" (json content) \
> H: SHA256 \
> \
> dA (private key) := H(Account|SDS) \
> QA := dA x G (secp256k1) \
> \
> dB private key of service \
> QB public key of service

### Secret sharing with internet Service
> Device reads QR {"m":"HWBA/1/SSR","a":"anon@example.com","x":"678a...deb6","y":"49f6...1d5f"} \
> \
> Method := "HWBA/1/SSR" \
> Account := "anon@example.com" \
> dA := H("anon@example.com"|"909a...8c4f") \
> QB := {x, y} \
> SecretA := (dA x QB == dA x dB X G).x \
> \
> Device displays QR {"m":"HWBA/1/SSA","x":"fdb0...1f61","y":"bc3f...6bf1"} \
> QA := {x, y} \
> SecretB := (dB x QA == dB x dA x G).x

### Register 2FA (RFC 4226/6238)
1. Service initiates secret sharing, displays SSR QR code
2. Device completes secret sharing, displays SSA QR code
3. Service and Device have a shared account specific secret
4. Service Requests confirmation PIN to complete setup, displays xOTP/A QR code
5. Device reads xOTP/A, generates and displays PIN
6. User enters PIN Service finalizes registration of 2FA Device

### Authenticate / Request HMAC 2FA Code (RFC 4226)
> Device reads QR {"m":"HWBA/1/HOTP/A","a":"anon@example.com","i":"0","x":"678a...deb6","y":"49f6...1d5f"} \
> Parameters (default): "p":{"a":"SHA256","d":6} \
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Algorithm: SHA256 (default), SHA512 (for future use) \
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Digits: 6 (default), 8
> \
> Method := "HWBA/1/HOTP/A" \
> Account := "anon@example.com" \
> dA := H("anon@example.com"|"909a...8c4f") \
> i := 0 \
> QB := {x, y} \
> SecretA := (dA x QB == dA x dB X G).x \
> \
> Code := HOTP(SecretA, SHA256, d, i) \
> \
> Device displays 6 digit Code

*Warning: very important that the server increments this iterator after every authentication attempt, and does not rely on the value presented by the client (like html hidden fields).*

### Authenticate / Request Time-based 2FA Code (RFC 6238)
> Device reads QR {"m":"HWBA/1/TOTP/A","a":"anon@example.com","x":"678a...deb6","y":"49f6...1d5f"} \
> Parameters (default): "p":{"a":"SHA256","d":6,"p":30} \
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Algorithm: SHA256 (default), SHA512 (for future use) \
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Digits: 6 (default), 8 \
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Period:	30 (default) seconds \
> \
> Method := "HWBA/1/TOTP/A" \
> Account := "anon@example.com" \
> dA := H("anon@example.com"|"909a...8c4f") \
> QB := {x, y} \
> SecretA := (dA x QB == dA x dB X G).x \
> \
> Code := TOTP(SecretA, SHA256, d, p, t) \
> \
> Device displays 6 digit Code (updates every 30 seconds)

### HOTP vs TOTP

Generally HOTP should be preferred when the login process can easily display a generated HOTP/A QR code. The main advantage of TOTP is, it can be used with a 'static' QR code that can even be printed out as part of the 2FA registration process or even stored on the Device if capabilities permit. The main disadvantage of TOTP is, it's theoretically replayable in a tight time interval, and also requires a synced internal clock. Service must make sure it will not accept 2 authentications with the same code, and should also limit the number of bad attempts considering the small entropy of the PINs. HOTP is more straightforward after every attempt the iterator should be increased and a new challenge QR code generated.

### Display password

1. User reads HWBA/1/PASS QR code with Device (from screen or paper)
2. Device creates a symmetric decryption Key from Account and SDS using i iterations of SHA512-HMAC, uses the Key to decrypt the encrypted password with a XOR cipher. Passphrase is encoded as ASCII/UTF-8 and is a 64 byte 0 terminated and padded string. \
*Example:* <code>MySuperSecretPa5sPhras3+</code> \
*Note: 512 bit means a maximum of 64 ASCII symbols or 32 extended latin or chinese symbols. Encrypted size is uniform 48 characters base64 ecoded.*
3. Device displays password in plain text (display may only reveal a small part of the password at once, not just for security reasons, but also to help manual input) \
	*Example:* \
	<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;MySu ></code> \
	<code>< perS ></code> \
	<code>< ecre ></code> \
	<code>< tPa5 ></code> \
	<code>< sPhr ></code> \
	<code>< as3+&nbsp;&nbsp;</code>

### Generate password
Too many options here would hinder the deterministic and simple nature of this function, therefore password strenght and charset will be preset, if it is not suitable the 'Display password' function can be used
1. User selects 'Generate password' function on the Device
2. User inputs the Account (like "anon@example.com") identifier using Device keys (alternatively read it from QR code)
3. Device generates a secret H(Iterator|Account|SDS) starting with 0 iterator 128 bit entropy (first 16 bytes) \
	*Example:* <code>874e82085aff4e3fac714a5a0dc0a42a</code>
4. Secret is displayed using base58 encoding and alphabet \
	*Example:* <code>Hi5Y2qLo9RTP85wUzJSmH3</code>
4. User may use navigation keys to iterate the password
5. Selected iteration is displayed (display may only reveal a small part of the password at once, not just for security reasons, but also to help manual input) \
	*Example:* \
	<code>&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi5Y ></code> \
	<code>< 2qLo ></code> \
	<code>< 9RTP ></code> \
	<code>< 85wU ></code> \
	<code>< zJSm ></code> \
	<code>< H3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code>
6. User is free to use only the first n character group of his password if weaker security and easier/faster input is desired. \
	*Example:* <code>Hi5Y2qLo</code> \
	*Warning: Forgetting this information may lead to forced password reset, only use for non-critical services that can be recovered by other means!*
